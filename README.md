  <h1>Introduction 🎬</h1>
  <p>
    I am a coding enthusiast and I've been hacking together small programs such as games and websites from back in 2012. I started learning JavaScript back then as well and have been professionally working in the field of App Development (mainly web) since 2017 after getting into college. During this time, I mostly focused on developing landing pages and small websites.
  </p>
  <h1>Background ✨</h1>
  <p>
    I started developing applications in Angular and Ionic in 2018. Since then, I have worked on many single page applications and produced cross platform applications which work on Desktop, Android, iOS and PWA. I also started learning many backend technologies as well such as Node, Express and MongoDB. My college classes complimented my online learning and I have been able to develop complete solutions for different problems using my skills as a Full Stack Developer.
  </p>
  <h1>Skills 👾</h1>
  <p>
    My skill set is quite diverse as I have learned by myself through the Internet but also through my college courses. My skills can be broken down into the general categories of Industries, Tools, Languages and Frameworks that I have learned and went through over the years.
  </p>
  <h2>Industries 🏗</h2>
  <p>
    In terms of industries, I am mostly self taught in frontend development. This includes web, hybrid and cross platform app development. I have extensive experience in backend development as well. I also learned native iOS development recently and have focused mostly on learning DevOps to automate CI/CD flows. Other than these skills, I have taken courses on AI, Machine Learning and BlockChain/Cryptocurrency in college and have learned a lot about these fields.

  </p>
  <h2>Technologies 💻</h2>
  <p>
    In terms of the specific languages, frameworks and tools that I use in these fields, I have extensive experience in JavaScript and Angular for front end development. I use Ionic for cross platform development and have gained experience in developing Flutter applications as well for iOS and Android. I have created a backend in Node, Express and MongoDB and a live database model similar to Firestore using Websockets.

  </p>
  <h2>Tools 💻</h2>
  <p>
    Many of the applications that I have worked on depend on Firebase services such as Authentication, Real Time Database, Firestore, Storage and many more. I have used SwiftUI for native iOS development and use Github Actions and Fastlane for Continuous Delivery of applications. For end to end testing of web applications, I use Cypress along with the Firebase Emulators suite.

  <h1>Open Source ❤️</h1>
  <p>
    I benefit a lot from Github and the open source community in general. I try to contribute back and have made most of my personal projects open source. I also try contributing by opening issues or creating useful PRs to solve issues in other open source projects such as <a href="https://github.com/thenewboston-developers/Website">The New Boston</a>.
