  <h2>Introduction 🎬</h2>
  <p>
    Hi, I’m Wajeeh, a Tech Entrepreneur and Full Stack Developer with extensive experience spanning over 5 years in developing robust, scalable web and mobile applications. My career is characterized by my role as a Product Engineer and Technical Advisor, where I lead strategic project development and provide technical consultation across various platforms.

  <h2>Tools 💻</h2>
  <p>
    Many of the applications that I have worked on depend on Firebase services such as Authentication, Real Time Database, Firestore, Storage and many more. I have used SwiftUI for native iOS development and use Github Actions and Fastlane for Continuous Delivery of applications. For end to end testing of web applications, I use Cypress along with the Firebase Emulators suite.
